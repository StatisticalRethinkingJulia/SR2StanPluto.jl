## Layout of the package

Instead of having all snippets in a single file, the snippets are organized by chapter and grouped in clips by related snippets. E.g. chapter 0 of the R package has snippets 0.1 to 0.5. Those have been combined into 2 clips:

1. `clip-01-03.jl` - contains snippets 0.1 through 0.3
2. `clip-04-05.jl` - contains snippets 0.4 and 0.5.

A single snippet clip will be referred to as `03/clip-02.jl`. 

Several chapters have intro sections to bridge differences between `rethinking` and StatisticalRethinking.jl.
