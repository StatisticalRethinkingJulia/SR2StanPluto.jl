# Introduction to a Stan Language program

using StatisticalRethinking

ProjDir = @__DIR__

The `rethinking` model is defined as:

flist <- alist(
  theta ~ Uniform(0, 1)
  k ~ Binomial(N, theta)
)

this model expressed as a Stan language model:

=#

m1_1s = "
// Inferring a rate
data {
  int N;
  int<lower=0> k[N];
  int<lower=1> n[N];
}
parameters {
  real<lower=0,upper=1> theta;
}
model {
  // Prior distribution for Î¸
  theta ~ uniform(0, 1);

  // Observed Counts
  k ~ binomial(n, theta);
}
";

#=

For this model 3 Stan language blocks are used: data,
parameters and the model block.

The first 2 blocks define the data and the parameters for the
model and at the same time can be used to define constraints.

This model represents N experiments tossing globe n times and
recording the results "k" (the number of "W"s observed in n
tosses). "W" is represented as 1, "L" as 0.

We know that k can't be negative. k ==0 indicates in n tosses
the globe never landed on "W". We also assume at least 1
toss is performed, hence n >= 1 (in below example we use 15
experiments of 9 tosses, thus n = 9 in all 15 trials).

N and the vectors k[N] and n[N] are all integers.

Theta, the fraction of water ~ the probability a toss lands on "W",
cannot be observed and is the parameter of interest. We know this
probability is between 0 an 1. Thus theta is also constrained in
the parameters block.

Theta is a real number.

The third block is the actual model and is pretty much identical
to R's alist.

Note that unfortunately the names of distributions such as Normal
and Binomial are not identical between Stan, R and Julia. The
Stan language uses the Stan convention (starts with lower case).
Also, each Stan language statement ends with a ";".

# Running a Stan language program in Julia

# Once the Stan language model is defined, in this case stored
# in the Julia variable m1_1s, below steps execute the program:

# 1. Create a Stanmodel object:

sm = SampleModel("m1.1s", m1_1s);

# 2. Simulate the results of 15 repetitions of 9 tosses.

N = 15                        # Number of experiments
d = Binomial(9, 0.66)         # 9 tosses (simulate 2/3 is water)
k = rand(d, N)                # Simulate 15 trial results
n = repeat([9], N)            # Each experiment has 9 tosses

# 3. Input data in the form of a Dict

m1_1_data = Dict("N" => N, "n" => n, "k" => k);

# 4. Sample using stan_sample.
 
rc = stan_sample(sm, data=m1_1_data);

# 5. Describe and check the results

if success(rc)

  # Describe the draws using Particles and Quap

  dfs = read_samples(sm; output_format=:dataframe)
  println("\nSample Particles summary:"); p = Particles(dfs); p |> display
  println("\nQuap Particles estimate:"); q = quap(dfs); display(q)

  # Check the chains using MCMCChains.jl
  
  chn = read_samples(sm; output_format=:mcmcchains)
  println()
  show(chn)
  savefig(plot(chn), "$ProjDir/Fig-part-1.png")

  # Display the stansummary result

  println()
  sdf = read_summary(sm)
  display(sdf)

end
